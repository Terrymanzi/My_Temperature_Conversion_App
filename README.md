# temperature_conversion_app

This app is built on Flutter.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo to your local storage
2. run flutter doctor doctor "to check if you have all environment variables and dependencies ready" if not install all necessary files
3. run this command "flutter run" in your termninal

Note:
YOU'LL NEED AN EMULATOR FOR THE APP TO RUN ON IF NOT, YOU'LL NEED A PHYSICAL DEVICE TO RUN THE APP

Flutter will build your apk file using Gladle so make sure all its dependencies are installed properly.
